# Implementation Plan: 서울시 공공자전거 "따릉이" 데이터 분석

**Branch**: `001-vs` | **Date**: 2025-09-09 | **Spec**: specs/001-vs/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a data analysis project for Seoul's public bicycle "Ddareungi" to identify operational inefficiencies and propose solutions. The technical approach involves using Python 3.13, `uv` for project management, `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for static visualizations, `streamlit` for interactive dashboards, and `geopandas` and `folium` for geospatial analysis and visualization. The analysis will be performed using a memory-efficient approach, processing large datasets in chunks or file-by-file to ensure scalability and performance.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.13  
**Primary Dependencies**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit, geopandas, folium  
**Storage**: Parquet files, CSV files  
**Testing**: Python unit tests (pytest), Streamlit application testing  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Python environment)
**Project Type**: Single (Data Analysis & Web Application)  
**Performance Goals**: Efficient processing of large datasets (Parquet), Responsive Streamlit application, Memory-efficient data processing by handling large files in chunks or streams.  
**Constraints**: Data size (up to 2025 data), Python 3.13 environment  
**Scale/Scope**: Analysis of Ddareungi usage data (2020-2025), Seoul population data (2020-2025), and bicycle station data

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: [#] (max 3 - e.g., api, cli, tests)
- Using framework directly? (no wrapper classes)
- Single data model? (no DTOs unless serialization differs)
- Avoiding patterns? (no Repository/UoW without proven need)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? (no direct app code)
- Libraries listed: [name + purpose for each]
- CLI per library: [commands with --help/--version/--format]
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned?

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? (test MUST fail first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation?
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed?
- Real dependencies used? (actual DBs, not mocks)
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas?
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase (Note: Testing is being skipped for this project as per user instruction.)

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included?
- Frontend logs → backend? (unified stream)
- Error context sufficient?

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? (MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD)
- BUILD increments on every change?
- Breaking changes handled? (parallel tests, migration plan)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project (Data Analysis & Streamlit App)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
